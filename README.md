# Instrument_control
During my time at DNA Script, I played a key role in developing and maintaining an internal Python-based
tool designed to streamline the work of engineers. This tool enabled them to efficiently program and execute
tests for hardware validation, new processes, and experimental solutions. My contributions extended beyond 
maintaining the main source code (which remains proprietary) to developing key features that significantly 
enhanced usability, automation, and efficiency.

# Key Contributions
# 1. Development and Maintenance of the Core System
  Contributed to the internal tool's design, implementation, and continuous improvement.
  Ensured stability and usability by maintaining and debugging critical components.
  Worked closely with engineers to integrate new testing capabilities into the tool, improving its ability to handle real-world instrument behavior.
# 2. Automation of Installation and Updates
  Developed Bash scripts to automate the installation and update process, significantly reducing setup time and minimizing manual intervention for engineers in the field.
  Ensured seamless deployment and upgrades across multiple systems, improving accessibility and ease of use for the team.
  I am able to share these scripts as an example of my work in automation.
# 3. Protocol Development for Instrument Simulation
  Designed and implemented several protocols to simulate instrument workflows, enabling engineers to test their software updates and new methodologies in a controlled environment.
  This helped validate changes before deployment, reducing unexpected issues during live operation.
# 4. Autoteachpoints – Automating Teachpoints Calibration
  Created Autoteachpoints, a project designed to automate the teachpoint calibration process.
  Reduced the calibration time from 2–4 hours (depending on operator experience) to just 20 minutes.
  Enhanced the instrument's self-diagnosis capabilities, allowing it to detect misalignments and notify engineers if a station was out of position, preventing errors before they could impact production.
  Implementation of logs for ease of use and help troubleshooting.
# Impact
  Increased efficiency by reducing manual testing efforts and accelerating development cycles.
  Improved reliability of hardware and process validation through automation and simulation.
  Empowered engineers with a flexible, robust, and automated testing framework.
